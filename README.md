### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rycca, and I am a Computer Engineering Technology - Computer Science student at Algonquin College in Ottawa, Canada.

I aspire to become a full-stack developer. Currently, I am in my second semester, focusing on Java and the Spring framework.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I engage in music production and enjoy playing video games.
